## How to run the web controller
You must run these commands in this order. Failure to do so will result in publish/subscribing errors.
1. Build and run the web controller.
   1. Go to the workspace containing the web controller, and run the commands below **DO NOT START THE NODE YET**
```
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```
2. Run the rosbridge server first. This node bridge ros to the browser. 
```
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```
3. Finally connect the ps5 contorller and open the index page. Use chrome or chromium-based browser as firefox have issue giving analog values for certain triggers.
```
google-chrome index.html
```
4. You should now see the `ps5_controller` with `ros2 topic list`:
```
cyclone@Cyclone-General:~/Web_controller$ ros2 topic list
/client_count
/connected_clients
/parameter_events
/ps5_controller
/rosout
```
